#### Metagovernance, or the governance of many worlds

Online governance is evolving. Competition, ideology, and technological advances have created the conditions for a new generation of games (e.g. [Minecraft](https://www.minecraft.net/en-us/realms/), [Seed](http://seed-project.io/)), social networks (e.g. [Mastodon](https://joinmastodon.org/), [Vingle](http://vingle.net/)), and collaborative platforms (e.g. [Aragon](https://aragon.org/), [Colony](https://colony.io/)). This new generation of online communities is changing the rules of online governance. In these worlds, users have constructed the right to _self-governance_â€”the right to come together and organize their own social and political institutions.&#x20;

However, on the internet, the right to self-governance is not a natural right; it is enabled and circumscribed by the architecture of the platforms on which people interact. Those same architectures also governs the interactions between separate user-generated institutions. _Metagovernance_ as a term describes these two related dynamics: (1) the systems that enable or constrain users' ability to create their own institutions, and (2) the systems that govern how seperate institutions interact, whether they be small groups, large communities, or formal institutional structures.

Our vision is to describe, support, and expand dynamics that enable the right to self-governance online.
