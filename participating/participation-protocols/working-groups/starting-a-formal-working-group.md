# Benefits of a Formal Working Group

## Working Groups <a href="#working-groups" id="working-groups"></a>

Working groups are the basic operational entities of the Metagovernance Project. They are active collaborations that contribute to the core mission, ranging from 2-3 people working on research papers to large 20-person teams working on a software project. You don’t have to form a working group to collaborate with other people in the Metagov community!

But becoming a formal working group is a way to participate in our shared resources, including:

* Publication on the [Metagov website](https://metagov.org/)
* Use of the Metagov legal and financial infrastructure
* Opportunities to coordinate and collaborate with other working groups, including at meetings of the [research directors](https://metagov.pubpub.org/pub/research-directors).

Further, leading a successful working group (formal or informal) is one of the criteria for being elected a member of the research directors, the primary research and coordinating body of the Metagovernance Project.

To start an informal working group, just join the Metagov Slack and start working with someone. For most people just joining the Metagov community, we recommend the informal route at first.

To start a formal working group, [apply here](https://forms.gle/Vxk1a7aibcMDToVf8). The application takes about 15 minutes.

## Application <a href="#application" id="application"></a>

To start a formal working group, use the [Google Form](https://forms.gle/Vxk1a7aibcMDToVf8). To start an informal working group, just start a Slack channel or message someone.

### Decision criteria <a href="#decision-criteria" id="decision-criteria"></a>

The core group uses the following criteria to evaluate working group applications:

1. Does the project synergize with the Metagov mission and other working groups?
2. Have participants already been engaged in the Metagov community and demonstrated collegiality?
3. Does Metagov have the capacity to support this working group, or should it be a separate entity?
4. Has a research director already agreed to oversee a working group, or does a nominated research director agree to over see a working group?

## Governance <a href="#governance" id="governance"></a>

The internal governance of a working group is up to its members, and governance processes should be publicly available. Presenting an initial version of working group governance is part of the application process.

## Working group lifecycle <a href="#working-group-lifecycle" id="working-group-lifecycle"></a>

We think of working groups like organisms. They don’t live forever, and they can mutate and split. Here’s a rough overview of how.

1. Pre-formation process
   1. Begin work and start to define scope and norms
   2. Identify need for greater participation in Metagov
2. Formation process
   1. Complete application
   2. Establish internal governance processes
   3. Receive notice of acceptance or feedback for re-applying
3. Sunsetting process
   1. Reach relevant milestone; either:
      1. Time-bound reached
      2. Milestone complete
      3. Absorbed into another project
      4. Waning participation
   2. Close down; either:
      1. Core group votes to remove the working group
      2. Working group decides to withdraw application
      3. Core group approves a new application for modified working group

To remain active, working groups should expect to do the following:

* Hold regular meetings and conduct regular activites
* Remain aligned with the core mission of the Metagovernance Project
* Publish current internal governance documents

Violations of the [Code of Conduct](https://metagov.pubpub.org/pub/cc-code-of-conduct) may result in a working group being removed from official recognition by the Core Group. A working group as a whole is accountable to the research directors and, if legal issues are involved, the Board of the Metagovernance Project.
