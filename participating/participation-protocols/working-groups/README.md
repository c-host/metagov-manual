# Working Groups

## What is a Working Group?

Working groups are the basic operational entities of the Metagovernance Project. They are active collaborations that contribute to the core mission, ranging from 2-3 people working on research papers to large 20-person teams working on a software project. Metagov recognizes two types of working groups:

1. Informal Working Groups
2. Formal Working Groups

### Informal Working Groups

Informal working groups are groups of people from the community that are working on projects without formal support from Metagov. They are usually the first step towards becoming a formal working group and are initiated through a mix of community forum discussion, seminar attendance, and working group observation.&#x20;

Examples of these types of collaborations include:&#x20;

* an experiment with stigmergic traces on the Metagov Slack
* dynamic systems mapping activities focused on research papers by Metagov researchers
* a reading group for digital ethnography in blockchain & governance
* a governance game using Metagov tooling

### Formal Working Groups

If, after a period of time working together, an informal working group wishes to formalize and seek support from Metagov in the form of publication on the Metagov website, use of Metagovâ€™s legal and financial infrastructure, and additional opportunities for cross working group coordination, group members are encouraged to [apply to be recognized as a formal working group](https://forms.gle/Vxk1a7aibcMDToVf8).
