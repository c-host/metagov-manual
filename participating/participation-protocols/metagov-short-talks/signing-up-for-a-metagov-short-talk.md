# Signing Up for a Metagov Short Talk

**Metagov Short Talk** is a series of monthly lightening talks featuring members of the Metagov community. The sessions are an opportunity for the community to come together and share our latest research, discuss interesting articles we've been reading, ask governance questions to our peers, and seek collaborators for projects we are working on.

Signup for Short Talks is limited to Metagov community participants.&#x20;
