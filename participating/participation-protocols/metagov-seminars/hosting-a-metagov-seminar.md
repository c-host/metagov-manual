# Hosting a Metagov Seminar

The Metagov Seminar is open to moderation from Metagov community participants. The sessions are primarily hosted by the community manager and select research directors, though we welcome facilitation by others in the community. Connect with Cent Hosten on the Metagov Slack (@Cent) who can mentor you through the process of hosting a seminar.
