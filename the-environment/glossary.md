# Glossary of Key Terms

According to Mark Bevir, in his book _Key Concepts in Governance_ (2007):

> The language of governance remains bewildering. One problem is that the key concepts of governance derive from diverse disciplines -- public administration, political science, economics, business, sociolgy -- and these disciplines rely tacitly on different assumptions. \[...] The language of governance is also bewildering because it covers both specific narratives about changes in the state and new theories of social coordination in general.&#x20;

The complexity that Bevir describes is compounded in the context of online governance, with the often intricate and obscured language that surrounds discussions of online spaces and technology. Even more so when concepts of metagovernance enter the frame.&#x20;

To help orient people interested in Metagov's mission, we offer this modest glossary of terms that are key to our understanding of online governance.&#x20;
