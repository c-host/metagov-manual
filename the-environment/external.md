Metagov lives mostly online, although weâ€™ve had a few in-person meetups in NYC, Denver, Amsterdam, Navarro, and hope to have more.&#x20;

Our digital lives are lived on:

* [Substack](https://metagov.substack.com/) (research and community news)
* [Medium](https://medium.com/metagov) (research blog)

* [Discourse](https://discourse.metagov.org/) (currently inactive, used mostly for Gateway testing)
