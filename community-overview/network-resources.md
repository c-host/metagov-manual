# Network Resources

Metagov maintains public collections of academic research published by our research network on both Zotero and Research Rabbit.

* 📚The Zotero collection can be found [here](https://www.zotero.org/groups/4734886/the-metagovernance-project/).
* 🔍The Research Rabbit can be found [here](https://www.researchrabbitapp.com/collection/public/OE6X8QWNLG).

The Research Rabbit collection is also embedded below (note: does not currently work on mobile), and is especially useful for research discovery.

We regularly expand these collections alongside the release of our [community newsletters](https://metagov.substack.com/) and new publications from the community.
