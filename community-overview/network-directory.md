# Network Directory

Metagov maintains a public directory for connecting researchers of digital and online governance. The directory includes bios, links, and research experience and interests. Community participants are encouraged to reach out within the community forum to any of the people listed here that have signaled that they are seeking collaborators.

Fill out our [network survey](joining-the-metagov-community/metagov-slack.md) for the opportunity to be added to this directory and connect with our community of researchers.

Metagov community member Isaac Mutemi has also compiled a Twitter [list of people working in Tech and Policy](https://twitter.com/i/lists/1579023890025791488), including several people from Metagov.
