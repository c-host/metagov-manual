Metagov is an open community of research and practice. Active participants are encouraged, but not required, to become contributing members of the organization. Membership isn’t prerequisite for participation in any way. The purpose of the membership program is to encourage wider participation in the Metagov community and to generate resources that support the facilitation and development of that community. The membership can also serve as the basis of developing stronger ties between the governance of the organization and its participants.
