# Forms of Participation



Metagov is an open community of research and practice. There are two types of community roles:&#x20;

* Participant&#x20;
* Member

## Participants

Participants are welcome to participate in Metagov's community forums. Our primary forum is an **invitation-only Slack**. People interested in participating in that forum are encouraged to complete [this survey](https://metagov.typeform.com/metagov-survey).&#x20;

### Survey Review

A member of the Metagov community maintenance team will review the submitted survey and either:

1. admit you to the Metagov Slack,
2. request additional information, or
3. direct you towards another of our public forums where your interests may be more aligned

Submission of the survey form does not guarantee admission to the community Slack.

You will also have an option towards the end of the survey to give Metagov permission to bridge parts of your submission to our [public directory of the Metagov network](https://metagov.pubpub.org/directory).

## Members

Active participants are encouraged, but not required, to become dues-paying members of the organization. Membership isnâ€™t prerequisite for participation in any way. The purpose of the this membership program is to encourage wider participation in the Metagov community and to generate resources that support the facilitation and development of that community. The membership can also serve as the basis of developing stronger ties between the governance of the organization and its participants.
