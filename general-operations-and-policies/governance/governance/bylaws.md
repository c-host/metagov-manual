This Corporation will, to the maximum extent permissible under applicable law, indemnify any person who was or is a party or is threatened to be made a party to any proceeding, by reason of the fact that such person is or was an agent of this Corporation, against expenses, judgments, fines, settlements, and other amounts actually and reasonably incurred in connection with such proceeding if such person acted in good faith and in a manner such person reasonably believed to be in the best interests of this Corporation and, in the case of a criminal proceeding, had no reasonable cause to believe the conduct of such person was unlawful.

The termination of any proceeding by judgment, order, settlement, conviction, or upon a plea of nolo contendere or its equivalent shall not, of itself, create a presumption that the person did not act in good faith and in a manner which the person reasonably believed to be in the best interests of this Corporation or that the person had reasonable cause to believe that the person's conduct was unlawful.

Section 9.5 Indemnification in Actions by or in the Right of the Corporation. This Corporation will, to the maximum extent permissible under applicable law, indemnify any person who was or is a party or is threatened to be made a party to any threatened, pending, or completed action by or in the right of this Corporation, to procure a judgment in its favor by reason of the fact that such person is or was an agent of this Corporation, against expenses actually and reasonably incurred by such person in connection with the defense or settlement of such action if such person acted in good faith, in a manner such person believed to be in the best interests of this Corporation, and with such care, including reasonable inquiry, as an ordinarily prudent person in a like position would use under similar circumstances.

No indemnification shall be made under this Section 9.5 in respect of any claim, issue, or matter as to which such person shall have been adjudged to be liable to this Corporation in the performance of such person's duty to this Corporation, unless and only to the extent that the court in which such proceeding is or was pending shall determine upon application that, in view of all the circumstances of the case, such person is fairly and reasonably entitled to indemnity for the expenses which such court shall determine.

Section 9.6 Indemnification Against Expenses.  To the extent that an agent of this Corporation has been successful on the merits in defense of any proceeding referred to in Section 9.4 or 9.5 of these Bylaws or in defense of any claim, issue or matter therein, the agent shall be indemnified against expenses actually and reasonably incurred by the agent in connection with those expenses.

Section 9.7 Required Determination.  Except as provided in Section 9.5 of these Bylaws, any indemnification under this Article IX shall be made by this Corporation only if authorized in the specific case, upon a determination that indemnification of the agent is proper in the circumstances because the agent has met the applicable standard of conduct set forth in Section 9.4 or 9.5 of these Bylaws by:

1. A majority vote of a quorum consisting of directors who are not parties to such proceeding; or
2. The court in which such proceeding is or was pending upon application made by this Corporation or the agent or the attorney or other person rendering services in connection with the defense, whether or not such application by the agent, attorney, or other person is opposed by this Corporation.

Expenses incurred by a person seeking indemnification under this Article in defending any proceeding covered by Article IX may be advanced by this Corporation prior to the final disposition of such proceeding upon receipt of an undertaking by or on behalf of the agent to repay such amount unless it shall be determined ultimately that the agent is entitled to be indemnified as authorized in this Article IX.

1. That it would be inconsistent with a provision of the Certificate, these Bylaws, or an agreement in effect at the time of the accrual of the alleged cause of action asserted in the proceeding in which the expenses were incurred or other amounts were paid, which prohibits or otherwise limits indemnification; or
2. That it would be inconsistent with any condition expressly imposed by a court in approving a settlement.

Section 9.11 Insurance.  This Corporation shall have the power to purchase and maintain insurance on behalf of any agent of this Corporation against any liability asserted against or incurred by the agent in such capacity or arising out of the agent's status as such whether or not this Corporation would have the power to indemnify the agent against such liability under the provisions of this Article.

**ARTICLE X: CONFLICTS OF INTEREST**

Section 10.1.  Purpose.  The purpose of the conflict of interest policy is to protect the

Corporation's interest when it is contemplating entering into a transaction or arrangement that might benefit the private interest of an officer or director of the Corporation or might result in a possible excess benefit transaction. This policy is intended to supplement but not replace any applicable state and federal laws governing conflict of interest applicable to nonprofit corporations.

Section 10.2.  Definitions.

1. “Interested Person”: Any Director, principal officer, or member of a committee with Board-delegated powers who has a direct or indirect financial interest, as defined below, is an interested person.
2. “Financial Interest”: A person has a financial interest if the person has, directly or indirectly, through business, investment, or family:

(i) An ownership or investment interest in any entity with which the Corporation has a transaction or arrangement;

(ii) A compensation arrangement with the Corporation or with any entity or individual with which the Corporation has a transaction or arrangement; or

(iii) Is considering an ownership or investment interest in or compensation arrangement with any entity or individual with which the Corporation is negotiating a transaction or arrangement.

1. “Compensation”: Direct and indirect remuneration, including gifts or favors that are not insubstantial.
2. “Conflict of Interest”: A conflict between the personal or financial interests and the official or professional responsibilities of a person in a position of trust; however, a financial interest is not necessarily a conflict of interest. A person who has a financial interest may have a conflict of interest only if the appropriate Board or committee decides that a conflict of interest exists.

Section 10.3.  Procedures.

1. Duty to Disclose. If an actual or possible conflict of interest arises, an interested person must disclose the existence of the financial interest and be given the opportunity to disclose all material facts to the Directors and members of committees considering the proposed transaction or arrangement.
2. Determining Whether a Conflict of Interest Exists. After disclosure of the financial interest and all material facts and after any discussion with the interested person, he or she shall leave the Board or committee meeting while the determination of a conflict of interest is discussed and voted upon. The remaining Board or committee members shall decide if a conflict of interest exists.
3. Procedures for Addressing the Conflict of Interest.
4. An interested person may make a presentation at the Board or committee meeting, but after the presentation, he or she shall leave the meeting during the discussion of and the vote on the transaction or arrangement involving the possible conflict of interest.
5. After exercising due diligence, the Board or committee shall determine whether the Corporation can obtain with reasonable efforts a more advantageous transaction or arrangement from a person or entity that would not give rise to a conflict of interest.
6. If a more advantageous transaction or arrangement is not reasonably possible under circumstances not producing a conflict of interest, the Board or committee shall determine by a majority vote of the disinterested Directors or committee members whether the transaction or arrangement is in the Corporation's best interest, for its own benefit, and whether it is fair and reasonable. In conformity with the above determination it shall make its decision as to whether to enter into the transaction or arrangement.
7. Violations of the Conflicts of Interest Policy.
8. If the Board or committee has reasonable cause to believe a Director or officer has failed to disclose actual or possible conflicts of interest, it shall inform the person of the basis for such belief and afford them an opportunity to explain the alleged failure to disclose.
9. If, after hearing the Director or officer's response and \*\*\*\*after making further investigation as warranted by the circumstances, the Board or committee determines the person has failed to disclose an actual or possible conflict of interest, it shall take appropriate disciplinary and corrective action.

Section 10.4.  Records of Proceedings.  The minutes of the Board and all committees with Board delegated powers shall contain:

1. The names of the persons who disclosed or otherwise were found to have a financial interest in connection with an actual or possible conflict of interest, the nature of the financial interest, any action taken to determine whether a conflict of interest was present, and the Board's or committee's decision as to whether a conflict of interest in fact existed.
2. The names of the persons who were present for discussions and votes relating to the transaction or arrangement, the content of the discussion, including any alternatives to the proposed transaction or arrangement, and a record of any votes taken in connection with the proceedings.

Section 10.5.  Compensation.

1. A member of the Board who receives compensation, directly or indirectly, from the Corporation for services is precluded from voting on matters pertaining to his or her compensation.
2. A member of any committee whose jurisdiction includes compensation matters and who receives compensation, directly or indirectly, from the Corporation for services is precluded from voting on matters pertaining to his or her compensation.

**ARTICLE XI. DISSOLUTION**

Section 11.1   The Corporation may be dissolved by at least a two-thirds vote of the members of the Board of Directors.

Section 11.2  Disposition of Funds.  Upon dissolution of the Corporation, the board of directors, after paying or making provision for the payment of all the liabilities of the Corporation, shall dispose of all the assets exclusively for the purposes of the Corporation and in such manner, or to such organization or organizations, as shall be deemed to qualify as devoted to the social welfare purpose of the Corporation.  In no event shall any of such assets or property be distributed to any member, director or officer, or any private individual.

Section 11.3  The Treasurer will take such action as is necessary to close the books of the Corporation, file any required closing reports with appropriate authorities, make a final audit, and give such notice as may be then required to interested parties that the Corporation will close its functions on the date selected by the Board of Directors.

**ARTICLE XII.  AMENDMENT OF THE BYLAWS**

These Bylaws may be amended at any Annual or Special Meeting of the Board of Directors by a two-thirds vote of all Directors then serving as Directors, provided that the proposed amendment has been submitted in writing to the Clerk of the Corporation at least fourteen (14) calendar days before the date of the meeting at which such amendment is to be considered at such meeting and circulated by the Clerk to all of the Directors at least ten (10) calendar days before the date of such meeting.
